Elecsimjs simulates easily an electronic circuit using Javascript language. It was conceived to design and 
simulate a new 8 bit computer, but, obviously, you can use it for your own purposes. 

It has three parts:

- The engine: This is the main system where the differents parts of the circuits are processed and draw.

- The library: Here every electronic component is described using Javascript clases.

- The circuit definition: Where the final user describe the circuit using simple methods.

The initial concepts:

- The system represent all the electronics elements as chips. It doesn't matter if you want to represent a resistance, 
  a transistor or a diode. All of them will be represented as chips.

- The chips always have an even number of pins. If the element you want to represent have an odd number of pins, 
  a transistor for example, just use the pins you need and leave the unused pin without connect.

- The lines have the voltage. Not the pins nor the chips.

Let start with the circuit definition:

The principal function is 'main()'. You can call others functions from this one, but it will not be necessary in a simple circuit.
Here are an example with comments:

function main()
{
  //This is the 
  var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
  contexto = canvas.getContext('2d');
 
  var line=[]; //Array for the diferents lines.

  //chips:
  var power=new e_power(200,50); // It create the Power chip. It is an invented but necessary chip.
  var timer=new e_timer05(250,100); // It create a timer chip. It is an invented chip.
  var led=new e_red_led(200,150); 
  var ls7400=new e_7400(350,200);
  var led2=new e_red_led(200,200);
  
  //To add lines to connect the pins of the chips:
  
  //Vcc:
  line[0]=new line();
  line[0].add_pin(power.pin[1]);
  line[0].add_pin(timer.pin[4]);
  line[0].add_pin(ls7400.pin[14]);
  
  //Ground:
  line[1]=new line();
  line[1].add_pin(power.pin[2]);
  line[1].add_pin(led.pin[2]);
  line[1].add_pin(timer.pin[2]);
  line[1].add_pin(ls7400.pin[7]);
  line[1].add_pin(led2.pin[2]);

  line[2]=new line();
  line[2].add_pin(timer.pin[1]);
  line[2].add_pin(led.pin[1]);
  line[2].add_pin(ls7400.pin[1]);
  line[2].add_pin(ls7400.pin[2]);
  
  line[3]=new line();
  line[3].add_pin(led2.pin[1]);
  line[3].add_pin(ls7400.pin[3]);
  
  //Draw lines:  
  for(var x=0; x<linea.length; x++) line[x].draw();
	
  //Switch on the power:	
  power.call_engine(); 
}
